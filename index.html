                    <p>I am an Internet of things, web development and startup enthusiast. I am currently in my pre-final year of B.Tech Computer Science Engineering from Vellore Institute of Technology, India. I have been developing web products for startups and am highly encouraged for being into one. Born and brought up in Gaya (Bihar) I spent my two years in Delhi before coming to college, traveled a lot of places in India.</p>

                    <p>Computers have always interested me. Apart from becoming an astronaut like every other child I always loved doing something experimental in computers. I got my first desktop computer in my fifth standard and that is when I figured out that I have to make something new with it. Getting help from a senior I started making small web pages using HTML when I was in seventh standard.</p>
                
                    <p>After coming to VIT I started following young entrepreneurs like Mark Zuckerberg and was highly motivated by them. My interest of making new things turned into making new things for people which could solve their problems. Learning programming and using it to make small applications which could help others became my passion. At the end of my first year I along with my few friends came up with an idea of a startup and I began developing it in my vacations. By the mid of my second year in college it was complete and released. Its popularity in a short span of time motivated us and that is where I figured out my interest for startups.</p>

                    <p>After a bit of a startup experience of my own, I went on for an internship in a startup which dealt with Internet of Things apart from web development. We worked on automatic drones and integrating the hardware with the software. Controlling and monitoring things from one single device is really fun and being an engineer when you make such things, it is enough for giving you thrills. This whole journey gave me a wonderful experience of working in such revolutionary environments, leading teams and managing development.</p>

                    <p>I have always followed the saying, "giving back to the society from where you have gained something." I am always up for helping my juniors and guiding them for any type of technical journey.</p>

                    <p><h3>Quotes that I follow</h3></p>

                    <p>"Move fast and break things. Unless you are breaking stuff, you are not moving fast enough." 
                    <br><strong>-Mark Zuckerberg</strong> CEO, Cofounder, Facebook</p>

                    <p>“Your work is going to fill a large part of your life, and the only way to be truly satisfied is to do what you believe is great work. And the only way to do great work is to love what you do.”  
                    <br><strong>–Steve Jobs</strong> Co-Founder, Chairman and CEO, Apple</p>

                    <p>“I knew that if I failed I wouldn’t regret that, but I knew the one thing I might regret is not trying.” 
                    <br><strong>–Jeff Bezos</strong> Founder and CEO, Amazon</p>

                                Headquartered in Vellore Institute of Technology Chennai, Cambuzz began as a side project and is now a tiny, bootstrapped idea helping the VIT Chennai family to share their events and is trying to become a go-to resource for discovering and connecting with everyone in the campus. Since the problems students faced in our campus were generic, we open sourced the platform to realize our vision of creating an equal playground in terms of opportunities and exposure.
                            </p>

                            <p><h3>Motivation</h3></p>

                            <p style="text-align: justify;">
                                In our freshman year, we felt that we were at a disadvantage in terms of exposure compared to the premier colleges in India. We realised that lot of complications in the existing education system in India are a manifestation of one core problem: effective communication.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                <img src="img/portfolio/problems.jpg" class="img-responsive img-centered" alt="">
                            </p>

                            <p><h3>Process</h3></p>

                            <p style="text-align: justify;">
                                Since we had literally no exposure to product building, we built Cambuzz solely on our instincts. Repeated user feedbacks helped in design iteration. All our team knew was:  
                                <br>
                                <i>Move fast and break things. Unless you are breaking stuff, you are not moving fast enough. - Mark Zuckerberg.</i>
                                <br>
                                Our brainstorming sessions happened in night after classes and we used whiteboards to conceptualize our product. Insights from the discussion included bringing the feature set from 8 to 3, changing the project workflow even it meant changing our operating system (Goodbye Windows, Hello Linux!), and learning about each member’s strength and weaknesses.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                <img src="img/portfolio/funnel.jpg" class="img-responsive img-centered" alt="">
                            </p>

                            <p style="text-align: justify;">
                                Ultimately we designed down on 3 main features:
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Buzz: get to know about all the events happening in our campus.</li>
                                    <li>Track Teacher: searchable database of teacher’s details and probable free slot for interaction.</li>
                                    <li>Q/A Forum: ask questions, get answers and network with your peers in our campus.</li>
                                </ul>
                            </p>

                            <p><h3>Low Fidelity Prototyping</h3></p>

                            <p style="text-align: justify;">
                                I didn’t even knew the process of making design related notes were actually called lo-fi prototyping! These were some of the notes we had made during the design ideation process:

                            <p><h3>Conclusion</h3></p>

                            <p style="text-align: justify;">
                                I felt that the system set an example to fellow students - by solving the first set of problems of increasing communication through the use of Internet-related technologies, we were able to show students that if “we could do it, you can too”, giving rise to multiple such entrepreneurial activities inside our college. After the initial success, people from other college started noticing and the more we spoke to our friends in other niche colleges, the more we felt that these problems are relevant and are not strictly limited to our own campus. So we open-sourced Cambuzz with the vision of starting a movement of networking and effective communication, without the friction of money and environment. One just needs motivation and little technical skills to deploy Cambuzz in their own university.
                            </p>
                            <p style="text-align: justify;">
                                Imagine the outcome if every campus in India, (even in the poor areas) have one copy of Cambuzz which is connected to other nodes. A mesh of opportunities, exposure, skill-set and exchange of ideas will be on the rise. We will be able to tap into the very resources that generate the maximum revenue for any country: the youth and enrich them more so they stay in India and make in India. Concept validation: when student lacking brick and mortar schools become successful.
                            </p>

                            <p><h3>If I could do it over?</h3></p>

                            <p style="text-align: justify;">
                                Reduce user friction: After the launch I realized the users found a lot of friction in even signing up. Since it was student run, our friends had notions like “Can the website be trusted with our privacy?”. User signups could have been much faster if we could have used Google or Facebook accounts for authentication.
                            </p>

                            <p style="text-align: justify;">
                                Social Media Marketing: Consumer tech products breath through user generated content. Content being shared on social media is one such way to gather tremendous exposure and increasing word of mouth growth. I forgot to include a share feature in Cambuzz! People weren’t able to share their content outside, which led to isolation of content and minimal consumer reach.
                            </p>

                            <p style="text-align: justify;">
                                Stop imagining all corner cases inside one room: I did conduct informal feedback sessions about Cambuzz. But I lacked breadth in terms of demographic since I had mostly interviewed students. Since the teachers also started taking interest, their insights were golden for Cambuzz.

                                A network of android applications which will bridge the gap between people and the daily traffic problems. It consists of three android applications, the first one is the user's application which consits of two sections.
                            </p>

                            <p style="text-align: justify;">
                                The first section is Traffic Feed (Userbase: Drivers, Pedestrians, Passengers). Users can post anything related to city traffic on the feed in order to inform other about it, this will be visible to everyone. Users can add image and tags in their posts to make their posts more comprehensible. Sample content of feed can be accident alert, traffic jam, congestion alert, or general post.
                            </p>

                            <p style="text-align: justify;">
                                The second section is Parking Finder (Drivers) Parking finder will show you nearby parking spots and the numbers of current free parking spots in the parking in real time. Real-time data is maintained by an IoT system and the second android application which I've built. This app will be used by the owner of the parking spot to put a display of the number of free spots of vehicles in the parking.
                            </p>

                            <p style="text-align: justify;">
                                The IoT system consists of two devices one at the entry and other at the exit. The device at the entry consists of a Raspberry Pi connected to a LDR and a buzzer on one side and a Laser Pointer on the other side. Now the Raspberry Pi consists a Python script running in it which is connected to the Firebase database via the internet. The script is also keeping a check on the LDR's reading via the GPIO pins. As soon as the reading goes below 0.5, which means the Laser's connection is broken by a vehicle, the value of the free spots is subtracted by one and updated in the Firebase. Similarly, on the exit, the value is updated by adding one in it. 
                            </p>

                            <p style="text-align: justify;">
                                The third application is the Gapp Traffic Feed Control Panel application. This application is built for and used by the traffic police. They can see, update, delete or appreciate any feed or user according to its legitimacy. The appreciation consists of five points which is added in the account of that particular user. These points act as community points which can be redeemed in the form of chalan payment or any other government services. This whole process will make lives much easier, smarter and safer.

                                I have built the IoT application and the API which will connect the whole network of applications. The system is based on Java for the Android part and I have used Python for the API.

                                The application is built on Web Sockets and Node JS. The frond end is based on Materialize CSS. This was deployed on a LAN network for the chit-passing in VIT Chennai Model United Nations. This is much similar to WhatsApp Webs except the file sharing option. MongoDb is being used for the database which is a No-Sql database. Currently I am working on making it work on an architecture-less network like Ad-Hoc wireless networks. The file sharing capacity is also under development.
